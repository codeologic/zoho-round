1. Replace every element with the greatest element on right side
Last Updated: 06-05-2019
Given an array of integers, replace every element with the next greatest element (greatest element on the right side) in the array. Since there is no element next to the last element, replace it with -1. For example, if the array is {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, then it should be modified to {17, 5, 5, 5, 2, -1}.

2. Given a Boolean matrix mat[M][N] of size M X N, modify it such that if a matrix cell mat[i][j] is 1 then make its adjacent cells as 0.

3. Equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes. For example, in an array A:
Example :
Input: A[] = {-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0}
Output: 3
3 is an equilibrium index, because:
A[0] + A[1] + A[2] = A[4] + A[5] + A[6]
Input: A[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: -1

4. In MS-Paint, when we take the brush to a pixel and click, the color of the region of that pixel is replaced with a new selected color. Following is the problem statement to do this task.
Given a 2D screen, location of a pixel in the screen and a color, replace color of the given pixel and all adjacent same colored pixels with the given color.
Example:
Input:
       screen[M][N] = {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
                      {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0},
                      {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1},
                      {1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0},
                      {1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0},
                      {1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0},
                      {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1},
                      {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1},
                      };
    x = 4, y = 4, newColor = 3
The values in the given 2D screen indicate colors of the pixels.
x and y are coordinates of the brush, newColor is the color that
should replace the previous color on screen[x][y] and all surrounding
pixels with same color.

Output:
Screen should be changed to following.
       screen[M][N] = {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
                      {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0},
                      {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1},
                      {1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0},
                      {1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0},
                      {1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0},
                      {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1},
                      {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1},

Output: aBuzC9012
(Replace the second ‘Z’ with ‘C’ as ‘a’ and ‘B’ are already there in the String. Replace with capital C as the letter to be replaced is capital Z. The second 9 turns out to be zero and the zero turns out to ‘1’ and the second zero turns out to ‘2’)

100. It is a program to implement Least Recently Used (LRU) concept. Given a key, if it is already existed then it should be marked as recently used otherwise a value should be stored which is given as input and marked as recently used. The capacity is to store only 10 key, value pairs. If the table is full and given a new key; the key, value pair which is not recently used should be deleted which gives feasibility to store the new key, value pair.

Input:
[
{Ram, Syam},
{Akil, Syam},
{Nikil, Ram},
{Subhash, Ram},
{Karthik, Akil}
];



Syam 2
Output: 3 (Syam has Ram and Akil in level 1 and in level 2 he have Nikil, Subhash, Karthik. So the answer is 3).

101 Given an array of positive integers. The output should be the number of occurrences of each number.

{2¬>3, 3¬>5, 7¬>8, ¬1¬>2, 8¬>11, 5¬>7, 11¬>} 
103) Find the largest sum contiguous subarray which should not have negative numbers. We have to print the sum and the corresponding array elements which brought up the
sum.



 
Sample: 
Array : {¬2, 7, 5, ¬1, 3, 2, 9, ¬7} 

Output: 
     Sum : 14 
     Elements : 3, 2, 9

  a   z  o   l 
  n   x  h   o
  v   y   i   v 
  o   r   s  e 
 Dictionary = {van, zoho, love, are, is} 
 
 Output: 
    zoho 
    love 
    Is 
 
106) Given a string, change the order of words in the string (last string should come first).
Should use RECURSION
