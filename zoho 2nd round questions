1. Replace every element with the greatest element on right side
Last Updated: 06-05-2019
Given an array of integers, replace every element with the next greatest element (greatest element on the right side) in the array. Since there is no element next to the last element, replace it with -1. For example, if the array is {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, then it should be modified to {17, 5, 5, 5, 2, -1}.
2. Given a Boolean matrix mat[M][N] of size M X N, modify it such that if a matrix cell mat[i][j] is 1 then make its adjacent cells as 0.
3. Equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes. For example, in an array A:
Example :
Input: A[] = {-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0}
Output: 3
3 is an equilibrium index, because:
A[0] + A[1] + A[2] = A[4] + A[5] + A[6]
Input: A[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: -1
4. In MS-Paint, when we take the brush to a pixel and click, the color of the region of that pixel is replaced with a new selected color. Following is the problem statement to do this task.
Given a 2D screen, location of a pixel in the screen and a color, replace color of the given pixel and all adjacent same colored pixels with the given color.
Example:
Input:
       screen[M][N] = {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
                      {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0},
                      {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1},
                      {1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0},
                      {1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0},
                      {1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0},
                      {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1},
                      {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1},
                      };
    x = 4, y = 4, newColor = 3
The values in the given 2D screen indicate colors of the pixels.
x and y are coordinates of the brush, newColor is the color that
should replace the previous color on screen[x][y] and all surrounding
pixels with same color.

Output:
Screen should be changed to following.
       screen[M][N] = {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
                      {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0},
                      {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1},
                      {1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0},
                      {1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0},
                      {1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0},
                      {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1},
                      {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1},

100. It is a program to implement Least Recently Used (LRU) concept. Given a key, if it is already existed then it should be marked as recently used otherwise a value should be stored which is given as input and marked as recently used. The capacity is to store only 10 key, value pairs. If the table is full and given a new key; the key, value pair which is not recently used should be deleted which gives feasibility to store the new key, value pair.

{Nikil, Ram},
{Subhash, Ram},
{Karthik, Akil}
];



Syam 2
